todo is a for developers to maintain and edit a list of tasks at the command line. Right now, functionality is limited to adding and removing items.
todo uses json files to store user todo lists.
Features like specifiying task priority, specifying files to write to, and more will be implemented soon.

todo [-a | --add] "string" -> add item to list
todo [-r | --remove] int -> remove item from list
todo -> print list
